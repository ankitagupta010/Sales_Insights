# Sales Insight Dashboard Using Power BI  

## About the Project  
This project focuses on creating a **Sales Insight Dashboard** for **AtliQ Hardware**, a company that sells computer hardware and peripherals. The goal was to help the Sales Director make better decisions by turning complex data into easy-to-understand visuals.  

I learned this project from the **Code Basics** YouTube channel. [Check out the playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeBasics).

## Problem Statement  
AtliQ Hardware was struggling with:  
- **Declining Sales**: Sales were dropping, and the reasons were unclear.  
- **Data Complexity**: The Sales Director found it hard to get clear insights from Excel sheets.  
- **Lack of Visuals**: Managers were sharing raw data instead of visuals, making it harder to interpret.

## Solution  
The team decided to create a **Power BI Dashboard** to:  
- Show sales performance clearly with visuals.  
- Highlight key trends and problems.  
- Make decision-making faster and easier.

## Steps I Followed  
1. **Planning**: Used the AIMS Grid method to organize the project.  
2. **Data Retrieval**: Pulled sales data from MySQL into Power BI.  
3. **Data Cleaning**: Fixed messy data using Power Query.  
4. **ETL Process**: Extracted, transformed, and loaded data for analysis.  
5. **Currency Fix**: Converted all transactions into the same currency.  
6. **Data Validation**: Double-checked the data for accuracy.  
7. **Visualization**: Built charts, graphs, and measures to display key insights.

## Key Changes I Made  
1. Fixed the **missing products issue** by creating a new product list and adding 60 products (Prod280 to Prod339).  
2. Updated the **Sales Transactions** table by including profit margin, cost price, and other useful calculations.
